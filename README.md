# oscria-game - the game made by crias

Hi! This is the open-source repo for the `oscria-game`, a rpg based game using `html`/`js` technologies.

## Installing Yarn

The project uses [yarn](https://www.yarnpkg.com) as package manger so you will need to have it installed locally.

In your terminal type

```bash
  npm install -g yarn
```
Installing dependencies
```bash
  yarn install
```

## Building the project

The project uses [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) to generate the our bundles which includes the core libs to develop this game.

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
	"build": ...
  },
}
```

To build the application just run the `build` script in your terminal (from the root directory)
```properties
  yarn build
```
